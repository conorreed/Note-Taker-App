# Note-Taker-Project

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)  

## Description
This is a project that allows the user to save notes and then stores them to a backend API. The user can choose to delete notes or go back to previous notes. This project taught me about HTML and API routes and also got me some experience with a new NPM package that helped me assign an ID to each note.

I created the App.js file and my dad helped me with debugging during the deployment process since i was having a lot of trouble getting deployment to heroku to work, I think this was due to the develop folder that was included in the starter code.
